Learn how to include third-party components in your pages.

## Embed a Tweet

Embed a Twitter Tweet in your page
using the [`amp-twitter`](/docs/reference/extended/amp-twitter.html) element.

To include a tweet in your page,
first include the following script in the `<head>`:

[sourcecode:html]
<script async custom-element="amp-twitter"
  src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-twitter-0.1.js"></script>
[/sourcecode]

Currently tweets are automatically proportionally scaled
to fit the provided size,
but this may yield less than ideal appearance.
Manually tweak the provided width and height or use the media attribute
to select the aspect ratio based on screen width.

Example `amp-twitter` from the
[twitter.amp example](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/examples/twitter.amp.html):

[sourcecode:html]
<amp-twitter width="390" height="50"
    layout="responsive"
    data-tweetid="638793490521001985">
</amp-twitter>
[/sourcecode]

## Embed an Instagram

Embed an Instagram in your page
using the [`amp-instagram`](/docs/reference/extended/amp-instagram.html) element.

To include an Instagram,
first include the following script in the `<head>`:

[sourcecode:html]
<script async custom-element="amp-instagram"
  src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-instagram-0.1.js"></script>
[/sourcecode]

Include the Instagram data-shortcode found in the Instagram photo URL.
For example, in `https://instagram.com/p/fBwFP`,
`fBwFP` is the data-shortcode.
Also, Instagram uses a fixed aspect ratio for responsive layouts,
so the value for width and height should be universal

[sourcecode:html]
<amp-instagram
    data-shortcode="fBwFP"
    width="320"
    height="392"
    layout="responsive">
</amp-instagram>
[/sourcecode]

## Display Facebook post or video

Display a Facebook post or video in your page
using the [`amp-facebook`](/docs/reference/extended/amp-facebook.html) element.

You must include the following script in the `<head>`:

[sourcecode:html]
<script async custom-element="amp-facebook"
  src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-facebook-0.1.js"></script>
[/sourcecode]

Example - Embedding a post:

[sourcecode:html]
<amp-facebook width="486" height="657"
    layout="responsive"
    data-href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102593740125791">
</amp-facebook>
[/sourcecode]

Example - Embedding a video:

[sourcecode:html]
<amp-facebook width="552" height="574"
    layout="responsive"
    data-embed-as="video"
    data-href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10102509264909801/">
</amp-facebook>
[/sourcecode]

## Include a YouTube video

Include a YouTube video in your page
using the [`amp-youtube`](/docs/reference/extended/amp-youtube.html) element.

You must include the following script in the `<head>`:

[sourcecode:html]
<script async custom-element="amp-youtube"
  src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-youtube-0.1.js"></script>
[/sourcecode]

The Youtube `data-videoid` can be found in every Youtube video page URL.
For example, in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1q71gFeRqM,
Z1q71gFeRqM is the video id.

Use `layout="responsive"` to yield correct layouts for 16:9 aspect ratio videos:

[sourcecode:html]
<amp-youtube
    data-videoid="mGENRKrdoGY"
    layout="responsive"
    width="480" height="270">
</amp-youtube>
[/sourcecode]

## Display an ad

Display an ad in your page
using the [`amp-ad`](/docs/reference/amp-ad.html) element.
Only ads served via HTTPS are supported.

No ad network provided JavaScript is allowed to run inside the AMP document.
Instead the AMP runtime loads an iframe from a
different origin (via iframe sandbox)
and executes the ad networkâ€™s JS inside that iframe sandbox.

You must specify the ad width and height, and the ad network type.
The `type` identifies the ad network's template.
Different ad types require different `data-*` attributes.

[sourcecode:html]
<amp-ad width="300" height="250"
    type="example"
    data-aax_size="300x250"
    data-aax_pubname="test123"
    data-aax_src="302">
</amp-ad>
[/sourcecode]

If supported by the ad network,
include a `placeholder`
to be shown if no ad is available:

[sourcecode:html]
<amp-ad width="300" height="250"
    type="example"
    data-aax_size="300x250"
    data-aax_pubname="test123"
    data-aax_src="302">
  <div placeholder>Have a great day!</div>
</amp-ad>
[/sourcecode]

AMP supports a wide range of ad networks. See [reference for a full list](/docs/reference/amp-ad.html#supported-ad-networks).
